About us...........
Yegwe Abikola – Entebbe Moto & Bicycle Tours
Yegwe Abikola means the one who makes things happen.
Yegwe Abikola Entebbe Moto & Bicycle Tours was born from a deep love for nature, people, and stories.
We believe that travel is not just about moving from one place to another, it is about connection, trust, and shared moments. Every ride we offer is guided by a local who understands the land, the culture, and the heartbeat of the community.Whether you ride with us on a motorbike or a bicycle, you are not just a passenger. You are a guest, a friend, and part of the journey. We take time to listen, to explain, to stop for photos, and to let you feel the real Entebbe beyond the usual tourist paths.
Safety, honesty, and respect are at the center of everything we do. We ride carefully, guide patiently, and serve with pride — because your experience matters to us.
When you choose Yegwe Abikola, you are choosing a local guide who works hard, cares deeply, and truly makes things happen — one ride, one story, one memory at a time.
